Exercise 2.22: Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:
if (p) // ...
if (*p) // ...

Ans: 
if (p) // this condition evaluates if the p is pointing to a pointer or nullptr (or 0), since we assume that p is a pointer to int, this condition returns true
if (*p) // this condition passes if the value in the integer pointed to by p is non-zero
