Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.
-> For rate - double, for principal - long long, for payment - long long. Rate can be something like 8.7% for example, so that would need float/double. Using double doesn't incur significant run-time performance and it seems to be faster hence double. principal and payment are usually rounded off positive integers and I assume they can be more than 2 raised to 16 - 1(considering the minimum guranteed size for unsigned int) which is 65535. Hence chose long long.
