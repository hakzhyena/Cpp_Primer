Exercise 2.15: Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why?
(a) int ival = 1.01; (b) int &rval1 = 1.01;
(c) int &rval2 = ival; (d) int &rval3;

Ans: a) int ival = 1.01; //valid definition, although the the value will be truncated.
     b) int &rval1 = 1.01; // invalid definition, you can't bind (lvalue) reference to an rvalue.
     c) int &rval2 = ival; //valid definition, don't see what more explaination I should give.
     d) int &rval3; //invalid definition, an lvalue reference must be bound to some object at the time of creation.
