Exercise 2.12: Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
(a) int double = 3.14; (b) int _;
(c) int catch-22; (d) int 1_or_2 = 1;
(e) double Double = 3.14;

(a) int double = 3.14; invalid because it uses a keyword as an identifer for variable name.
(b) int _; surprisingly valid but super non-userfriendly name.
(c) int catch-22; invalid because catch is a keyword.
(d) int 1_or_2 = 1; invalid because variable names can either be started with letters or an underscore.
(e) double Double = 3.14; //valid but starting a variable name with Uppercase letter is unconventional.
