Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.
(a) int* ip, i, &r = i; (b) int i, *ip = 0; (c) int* ip, ip2;

Ans:

(a) int* ip, i, &r = i; // ip is an integer pointer, i is an integer and r is a reference to integer i.
(b) int i, *ip = 0; // i is an integer variabl, ip is a pointer to int initialized to 0.
(c) int* ip, ip2; // ip is a pointer to int, ip2 is an integer.
