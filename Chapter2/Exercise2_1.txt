Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
-> int is atleast as big as short. short can be minimum of 16 bits of size.
-> long is atleast as big as int. int and long are usually of 32 bits size.
-> long long is alteast as big as long. long long is usually of 64 bits size. 
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?
-> signed should be used when both positive and negative numbers need to be stored. unsigned should be used for storing only positive numbers and zero. 
-> float and double have 7 and 16 significant digits respectively.

Exercise 2.2: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.
-> For rate - double, for principal - long long, for payment - long long. Rate can be something like 8.7% for example, so that would need float/double. Using double doesn't incur significant run-time performance and it seems to be faster hence double. principal and payment are usually rounded off positive integers and I assume they can be more than 2 raised to 16 - 1(considering the minimum guranteed size for unsigned int) which is 65535. Hence chose long long.
