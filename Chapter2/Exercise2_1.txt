Exercise 2.1: What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short?
-> int is atleast as big as short. short can be minimum of 16 bits of size.
-> long is atleast as big as int. int and long are usually of 32 bits size.
-> long long is alteast as big as long. long long is usually of 64 bits size. 
Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?
-> signed should be used when both positive and negative numbers need to be stored. unsigned should be used for storing only positive numbers and zero. 
-> float and double have 7 and 16 significant digits respectively.
