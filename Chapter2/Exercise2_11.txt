Exercise 2.11: Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or a definition:
(a) extern int ix = 1024;
(b) int iy;
(c) extern int iz;

(a) extern int ix = 1024; - This is a definition since ix is also initialized explicitly.
(b) int iy; // This is a declaration also definition because it is also creating storage for that variable.
(c) extern int iz; //This is a pure declaration. Neat and clean!
