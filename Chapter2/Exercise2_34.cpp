/*Exercise 2.34: Write a program containing the variables and assignments from the
previous exercise. Print the variables before and after the assignments to check
whether your predictions in the previous exercisewere correct. If not, study the examples
until you can convince yourself you know what led you to the wrong conclusion.*/
