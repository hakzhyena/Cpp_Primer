Exercise 2.10: What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?
std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
int local_int;
std::string local_str;
}

global_str would have an initial value of 'empty string'.
global_int would have an initial value of 0.
local_int's initial value of would be undefined since it is not default initialized as it is in a function (local scope).
local_str's initial value would be an 'empty string'.
