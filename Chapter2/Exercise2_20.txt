Exercise 2.20: What does the following program do?
int i = 42;
int *p1 = &i;
*p1 = *p1 * *p1;

Ans: 
int i = 42; //defined an object i of type int
int *p1 = &i; // defined a pointer p1 of type int and initialized it to point to i
*p1 = *p1 * *p1; //assigned the object p1 is pointing to meaning i with the value of current i value multiplied by current i value, so i would have multiplication of //42 * 42.
