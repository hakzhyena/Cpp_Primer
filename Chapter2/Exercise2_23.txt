Exercise 2.23: Given a pointer p, can you determinewhether p points to a valid object?
If so, how? If not, why not?

The definition of a valid pointer is pointer pointing to an object, a location past the object or nullptr. That we can decide with
if (p)
{
}else
{

}

But what we can't determine is an uninitialized pointer in a block scope.
