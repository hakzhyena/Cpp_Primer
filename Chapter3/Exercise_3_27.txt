Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns
an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain why.
unsigned buf_size = 1024;
(a) int ia[buf_size]; (b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
(c) int ia[txt_size()]; (d) char st[11] = "fundamental";

Ans: int txt_size(){}

(a) illegal because array dimension is not a const expression.

(b) legal

(c) illegal because txt_size() returns an int not constexpr int

(d) st doesn't have space for null terminator, hence illegal declaration.
