Exercise 3.18: Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?
vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;

Ans: It's not legal, because your ivec has zero elements and you are trying to access 0th element so resulting behaviour would be undefined. We can fix it by atleast giving it size 1.

vector<int> ivec(1); // Paranthesis are now used to mention elements and value initialize them
ivec[0] = 42;
