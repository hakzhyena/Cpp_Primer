/*Exercise 3.21: Redo the first exercise from ยง 3.3.3 (p. 105) using iterators.
 The first exercise is : -
Exercise 3.16: Write a program to print the size and contents of the vectors from exercise 3.13. Check whether your answers to that exercise were correct. If not, restudy ยง 3.3.1 (p. 97) until you understand why you were wrong.

which in turn was: 

Exercise 3.13: How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What
are the values of the elements?
(a) vector<int> v1; (b) vector<int> v2(10);
(c) vector<int> v3(10, 42); (d) vector<int> v4{10};
(e) vector<int> v5{10, 42}; (f) vector<string> v6{10};
(g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};
