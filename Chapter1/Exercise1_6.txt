Exercise 1.6: Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
<< " and " << v2;
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How
would you fix it?

Answer: The above mentioned program fragment isn't legal because the line containing v2 doesn't have std::cout before << and the same is true for the line following it. Because this the program would result in compilation errors.
I woudl add std::cout at the beginning of line 3 and 4 (line numbers as per the current file).
